A significant limitation of this study pertains to the disparate performance observed across the 
machine learning models utilized. While the LightGBM algorithm demonstrated considerable 
promise by achieving a high R2 and low RMSE in delivery time prediction, the efficacy of 
other models varied significantly. For instance, the Multiple Linear Regression and Support 
Vector Regression (SVR) models exhibited notable deficiencies in accurately predicting 
delivery times, indicating a poor fit to the data. This discrepancy underscores the complexity 
inherent in the dataset and the inherent challenges of the delivery time prediction domain. It 
suggests that the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms can vary significantly depending 
on the nature of the data and the intricacies of the problem being addressed. 
Moreover, the limitations of the study extend beyond the performance of individual models. 
The selection of machine learning algorithms, while encompassing a range of regression 
techniques, was limited to seven common approaches. While Random Forest, XGBoost and 
LightGBM performed the best, exploring a broader range of advanced techniques or 
hyperparameter tuning could have potentially yielded even superior results. 
Furthermore, the study's focus on delivery time prediction may not fully capture the diverse 
array of challenges and complexities present in food delivery operations. While delivery time 
is a critical aspect, other factors such as customer satisfaction, route optimization, and resource 
allocation could also significantly impact operational efficiency and performance. Thus, the 
study's findings may only offer a partial understanding of the broader landscape of food 
delivery management challenges. 
In conclusion, while the study provides valuable insights into the application of machine 
learning in delivery time prediction, its findings should be interpreted within the context of the 
aforementioned limitations. Future research endeavors should aim to address these limitations 
by exploring a wider range of machine learning techniques, incorporating more comprehensive 
datasets, and considering a broader spectrum of food delivery management challenges. By 
doing so, researchers can advance our understanding of the complexities inherent in food 
delivery operations and develop more robust and effective solutions to optimize them.
